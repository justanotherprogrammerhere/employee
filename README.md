# Emplyee portal 
This is an example Employee portal application written to list and add employees. 
Have used TDD approach to build this application.

The code is divided into two folders:
1)Server_Code: Backend Java and Spring boot code with REST support.
2)UI_Code: Angular 7 code for UI support for Backend
